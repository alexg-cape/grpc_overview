# gRPC overview and exmaple
## Motivation
1. Communication between different languages
    a. Microservices may not be the same language
    b. API Contracts
2. Communication should be efficient | Fast & Lightweight
    a. Huge amount of information between services
    b. Mobile networks can be slow with limited bandwidth
3. Communication should be simple
    a. Client and Server cna focus on core logic

## Code Generation with Protocol Buffer
1. How stubs are generated
    a. API Contracts created in .proto file
    b. Server and Client stubs are generated by the Protocol Buffer compiler (protoc)
2. Protocol Buffer rationale
    a. Human-readable Interface Definition Lanuage (IDL)
    b. Programming languages interoperable:
        - Code generators for many supported languages
    c. Binary data representation:
        - Smaller size
        - Faster transport
        - Efficient serialization/ deserialization
        - Strongly typed Contracts

## HTTP2 is used as the transfer protocol
    a. Binary Framing
        - More performant and robust
        - Lighter to transport, safer to decode
        - Great combination with Protocol Buffer
    b. Header compression using HPACK
        - Reduce overhead and imporoved performance
    c. Multiplexing
        - Send multiple requests and responses in parellel over a single TCP connection
        - Reduced latency and improved network utilization
    d. Server Push
        - One client request, multiple responses
        - Reduced round trip latency

## gRPC best use cases
1. Microservices
    - Low latencty and high throughput communnication
    - Strong API Contracts
2. Polyglot environments
    - Code generation out of the box in many languages
3. Point-to-point Realtime Communication
    - Excelent support for bidirectional streaming
4. Network constrained environments
    - Lightweight message format
